# Drum-Kit-

I built a drum kit website using HTML, CSS, JS using DOM. This was a really fun project to work on. 


# How to play

Either click on the buttons or tap on the keyboard to play the corresponding drum sounds and make melodous music. 


#My Thoughts

I really enjoyed this project, because I was able to combine everything I learnt from the front end to create the website.
